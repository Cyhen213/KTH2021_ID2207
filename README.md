For MacOS, you can use similar methods to compile and run the code in the terminal. For windows, you can use WSL to compile and run the code with similar methods, or you can use an IDE to compile and run the code.

## Honor_Code
If there are similar questions, problem sets or projects in the future, it is the responsibility of KTH students not to copy or modify these codes, or other files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository doesn't take any commitment for other's faults.
